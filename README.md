This is a collection of Archery apps for tournaments and training. All
web-based, written in vanilla Javascript and VueJS. AWS DynamoDB and
AWS Lambda are the database.

Handles Indoor and Outdoor World Archery formats with variable end length.

## Tournament Scorekeeper
[dwhitnee.github.io/archery/tournament](https://dwhitnee.github.io/archery/tournament)

Scoring is done on a phone or tablet for each bale.
Create a tournament, then have one archer on each bale scan the QR
Code and start scoring. That's it.
