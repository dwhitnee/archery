## About
This is a simple Timer used for Archery Tournaments.

Handles Indoor and Outdoor World Archery formats with variable end length.
By default this is two minutes indoor and four minutes outdoor with a 10 second prep time.

No canvas, just HTML elements and CSS.

Inspired by the myriad iOS, Android, and Windows timer apps that are
all wonderful but seem to always fall just short and require different devices to make work.
